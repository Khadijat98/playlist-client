# Borahae Playlists
**Made by Khadijat Oyeleye**

This is a full stack playlist application made using React , Java and MySQL.

This project was created in weeks 11-12 of the _nology course. The aim was to apply the skills we had gained throughout the course to our first full stack project.

## Project Description
### Overview
Due to my love of the group BTS, I decided to create an application where users could access a database of 133 of their songs, which I created manually using MySQL, and create playlists.

### Creating Playlists
This is a form with fields for the author's name, the title of their playlist, the playlist image URL, the playlist description and the songs, which were fetched with their title from the database. After filling in these fields and pressing the 'Create Playlist' button, a POST request is submitted to the API. All fields in string form, with the songs selected by their IDs which were converted into strings.
